# Johnson's Dictionary Quotes parsing project

This is an archived copy of a UCF Senior Design project that processed ~120,000 quotations referenced in Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language. The program used open-source repositories of texts to find the origins of Johnson's quotes. This information will be incorportated into Johnson's Dictionary Online project (https://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com).
